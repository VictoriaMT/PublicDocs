The following document will cover the installation steps & usage of the Olapic Shopify App.

## Overview
Simplifying the product feed integration steps and maintenance, Olapic developed the Olapic App for Shopify, which automatically exports all your products from your Shopify catalog to Olapic, saving time and ensuring accuracy. Specifically, the integration:

1. Eliminates the need for a manually-created product feed using third-party feed plugins.
1. Accurately translates your product catalog into an XML feed in Olapic schema (for more information, please refer to http://developer.olapic.com/articles/product-feed-full-public.html), ensuring proper product & schema matching.
1. Ensures refreshed and up-to-date inventory, as the application will generate an updated feed from your store every 24 hours.

2. Click the "Enable" toggle button under the "Status" card to enable the job. Since you donâ€™t have the FTP configuration details filled out yet, you will have to enter the FTP credentials provided by your Olapic Solutions Architect or Support team.

    Please note that you will not be able to save unless you supply authorized credentials. 

3. Once you save you are done! The Olapic app will automatically export your products to the supplied FTP account around midnight UTC.
